## Quick Start

**NOTE**:
    The Docker command provided in this quick start is an example, and parameters
    should be adjusted to suit your needs.

Launch the MKV Muxing Batch GUI docker container with the following command:
```shell
docker run -d \
    --name=mkv-muxing-batch-gui \
    -p 5800:5800 \
    -v /docker/appdata/mkv-muxing-batch-gui:/config:rw \
    -v /home/user:/storage:rw \
    jlesage/mkv-muxing-batch-gui
```

Where:

  - `/docker/appdata/mkv-muxing-batch-gui`: Stores the application's configuration, state, logs, and any files requiring persistency.
  - `/home/user`: Contains files from the host that need to be accessible to the application.

Access the MKV Muxing Batch GUI GUI by browsing to `http://your-host-ip:5800`.
Files from the host appear under the `/storage` folder in the container.
